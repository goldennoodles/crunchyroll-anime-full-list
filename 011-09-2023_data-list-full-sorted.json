Tasked with preventing the destruction of humanity, the Chaldea Security Organization observes an anomaly: the Near-Future Observation Lens: Sheba proved the extinction of humanity in 2019. Chaldea pinpoints space-time Singularities thought to be the cause of humanity’s extinction and executes a forbidden ceremony called Rayshifting, where mages are converted into Spiritrons and sent into the past to restore humanity. However, immediately after the Rayshift is executed, an unknown individual causes the Central Command Room to explode, thwarting the plan to save humanity. Romani Archaman, the head of Chaldea’s medical department, managed to escape the accident. A civilian named Ritsuka Fujimaru came out unscathed as well. Mash Kyrielight, a member of Chaldea’s staff, was caught in the explosion, but pulled through because she had been fused with a Heroic Spirit. Under the command of Romani and with the aid of numerous Servants, Ritsuka Fujimaru and Mash Kyrielight begin by restoring Singularity F: Flame Contaminated City, Fuyuki. From there, they make their way through seven Singularities, resolving each of them. And now, the path to the Final Singularity, Grand Temple of Time: Solomon, lies open, and the final battle against the King of Mages is underway.",
